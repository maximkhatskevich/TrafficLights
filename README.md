# Introduction

A single-view iOS app that simulates a set of traffic lights at an intersection.

# Requirements

## Layout

The traffic lights should be arranged North-South and East-West like a compass. And there should be a button to start/stop the animation.

## Logic

When switching from green to red, the yellow light must be displayed for 5 seconds prior to it switching to red. The lights will change automatically every 30 seconds.

## Other

The app should be written using Swift 3. Any external libraries should be included in the project directly.

# Approach
